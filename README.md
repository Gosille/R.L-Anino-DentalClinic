# R.L-Anino-DentalClinic

I'm Creating My Dental Clinic for testing only if it runs the entire system.

## Two Versions Available

This repository contains two versions of the dental clinic system:

### 1. PHP/MySQL Version (Traditional)
- Full-featured system with server-side processing
- Requires a web server with PHP and MySQL support
- Located in the main directory structure

### 2. HTML/JavaScript Version (Client-Side)
- Static version that runs in the browser without a server
- Uses JavaScript and localStorage instead of PHP/MySQL
- Perfect for GitHub Pages deployment

## From the Index is Homepage
- Adding Image for Gallery and Slider
- Adding Css for Style
- Adding Java for Script
- Adding hms for user, Admin and Dentist

## JavaScript Database Implementation

For the client-side version, I've created a JavaScript implementation of your database:
- `js/database.js` - JavaScript database that replaces MySQL
- `js-demo.html` - Demo page showing how to use the database
- `test-database.html` - Test page to verify database functionality
- `js-login.html` - Simple login page using the JavaScript database
- `JS_DATABASE_README.md` - Detailed documentation

## Testing the JavaScript Version

To test the JavaScript version of your system:
1. Open `test-database.html` to verify the database is working
2. Open `js-login.html` to test the login functionality
3. Open `js-demo.html` to see a more comprehensive demo
